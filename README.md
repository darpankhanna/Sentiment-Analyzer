# Twitter_Sentiment-Analyzer

## Introduction 

Sentiment analysis refers to identifying as well as classifying the sentiments that are expressed in the text source. Tweets are often useful in generating a vast amount of sentiment data upon analysis. These data are useful in understanding the opinion of the people about a variety of topics.Therefore we need to develop an Automated Machine Learning Sentiment Analysis Model in order to compute the customer perception.


## Problem Statement
Due to the presence of non-useful characters (collectively termed as the noise) along with useful data, it becomes difficult to implement models on them.I aimed to analyze the sentiment of the tweets provided from the Sentiment140 dataset by developing a machine learning pipeline.
In this project, I tried to implement a Twitter sentiment analysis model that helps to overcome the challenges of identifying the sentiments of the tweets. 

The necessary details regarding the dataset are:

The dataset provided consists of 7000 tweets that have been extracted using the Twitter API.
