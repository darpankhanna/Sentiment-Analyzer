# Twitter_Sentiment-Analyzer

## Introduction 

Sentiment analysis refers to identifying as well as classifying the sentiments that are expressed in the text source. Tweets are often useful in generating a vast amount of sentiment data upon analysis. These data are useful in understanding the opinion of the people about a variety of topics.Therefore we need to develop an Automated Machine Learning Sentiment Analysis Model in order to compute the customer perception.

## Getting Started 
The project requires authentication via the Twitter API. A new application needs to be created to get the necessary keys. A few libraries also need to be installed for the script to run properly.

## Problem Statement
Due to the presence of non-useful characters (collectively termed as the noise) along with useful data, it becomes difficult to implement models on them. I aimed to analyze the sentiment of the tweets provided, by developing a machine learning pipeline.
In this project, I tried to implement a Twitter sentiment analysis model that helps to overcome the challenges of identifying the sentiments of the tweets. 

## Pre-requisites 

* [Tweepy](https://www.tweepy.org/) , the official Python library for accessing the Twitter API 
* [TextBlob](https://textblob.readthedocs.io/en/dev/) , a Python library for processing textual data 
* [NTLK dataset](https://www.nltk.org/) , to help better natural language processing 
* Keys from the [Twitter Developer Application Management site](https://twitter.com/i/flow/login?input_flow_data=%7B%22requested_variant%22%3A%22eyJyZWRpcmVjdF9hZnRlcl9sb2dpbiI6Imh0dHBzOi8vZGV2ZWxvcGVyLnR3aXR0ZXIuY29tL2FwcHMifQ%3D%3D%22%7D)
   * Consumer key 
   * Consumer secret 
   * Access token 
   * Access token secret 

The dataset provided consists of 7000 tweets that have been extracted using the Twitter API.
